So now that you've written some HTML, let's make it look stylish by writing some
  CSS. CSS works by choosing an HTML element (like <p>) and then changing it's properties.
  Here are some properties to get you started:

1) text-align: This changes where the content is positioned within its boundary.
possible values - left, center, right, none
p {
  text-align: center;
}

2) border: Adds a border-line around an element.
  This property take 3 keywords: color, width, and style.
p {
  border: red medium solid
}

3) background-color: Changes the color behind the element.
p{
  background-color: blue;
}

4) color: Changes the color of text.
p{
  color: green;
}

5) margin: Adds space around the element on all sides.
  Unlike the others, margin only takes numbers with units. Also, you can add space on
  one side by using "margin-left" or "margin-top" etc.
div{
  margin: 2px;
}
OR
div{
  margin-top: 5px;
}

If you have more than one element of the same type (hint: a book chapter with more than
  one paragraph) you can one of those elements an id in order to make it easier to select.
  In this example, the first paragraph's text will be blue but the second will be red.

<html>
<body>
  <p> Paragraph One </p>
  <p id="P2"> Paragraph Two </p>
</body>
</html>

p {
  color: blue;
}

#id {
  color: red;
}
