    This is an introduction to HTML, the language that gives websites their form.
    This webpage could use a bit of work, why don't you look around and see what you
    can fix.

    This is a lot of text. Let's see if we can clean this up with headers and paragraph tags.

    <h3>CHAPTER I. <em>Down the Rabbit-Hole</em></h3>
    <p>
      Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
      bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
      book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
      it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or
      conversations?’
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
      hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
      of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
      picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
      close by her.
