  Welcome to the wonderful world of programming!

  This is an introduction to HTML, the language that gives websites their form.
  This webpage could use a bit of work, why don't you look around and see what you
    can fix.

  <!-- Put a line break in between these two lines with a "br" tag -->
  <!-- or take a look at the "pre" tag, (Text appears as typed on page) -->

  This is a lot of text. Let's see if we can clean this up with headers and paragraph tags.


  <!-- Surround these next three sections in a div tag, so we can easily find it later -->

  <!-- Change the line below to a header by surrounding it in an "h#" tag.

  CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

  <!-- Surround these two sections in a "p" tag -->
  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
  bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
  book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
  it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or
  conversations?’

  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
  hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
  of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
  picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
  close by her.

  <!-- This website is nice, but other people will surely want to see other parts of
    the internet too. Why don't you show them you're favorite candy? Find a website that
    talks about the candy you chose, copy the url, and add it to this webpage as a link
    with the "a" tag. The url will go right after the "href" variable, like so:
    <a href="https://www.google.com">google</a> -->

  <!-- Surround this line in an "h" tag -->
  My favorite fruits:

  <!-- What a mess! Make these into an ordered list by surrounding all of the elements in an "ol"
    tag, and then surround each individual list item in a "li" tag -->
  Apples
  Bannanas
  Oranges
  Strawberries
  Tomatoes
  Potatoes

  <!-- Pick one of the fruits from the list and find a picture of it on google. Copy the url and
    paste it into an "img" tag. Replace the "W" and "H" with your own numbers.
